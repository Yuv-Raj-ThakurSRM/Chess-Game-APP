Project Overview
The Chess Game System is an interactive, fully functional chess application developed in Java. It provides both Player vs Player and Player vs Computer gameplay with varying AI difficulty levels. Designed to teach and demonstrate object-oriented principles, it models chess pieces and game mechanics using class-based design for clarity and scalability.

Features

Player vs Player mode

Player vs Computer mode (AI: Easy, Medium, Hard)

Move validation and rule enforcement

Check, checkmate, and stalemate detection

Undo and restart options

Colorful, user-friendly GUI (Java Swing, optional JavaFX)

Modular code for scalability

Save/Load and replay features (future enhancement)

AI based on Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms

Requirements

Programming Language: Java (JDK 1.8+)

IDE: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans

GUI Framework: Java Swing/JavaFX

AI: Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning

Database: MySQL/SQLite (for multiplayer, future)

OS: Windows, Linux, macOS

Usage Instructions

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

Build the project using Java JDK 1.8 or later.

Run the main class to launch the GUI.

Select either PvP or PvC mode, choose AI difficulty (if PvC).

Play the game using GUI controls.

Use restart or undo buttons for enhanced gameplay flexibility.

Architecture

Presentation Layer: GUI (Swing/JavaFX)

Business Logic Layer: Game engine, AI logic

Data Layer: Database support for saved games/multiplayer (optional)

Modular Structure: Each chess piece is a class inheriting from a common superclass for clean code and polymorphic behavior.

Development Timeline Example

Week 1-2: Setup & GUI design

Week 3-4: Move validation

Week 5-6: PvP gameplay

Week 7-8: AI development

Week 9-10: Undo/Restart, testing

Week 11-12: Save/Load, multiplayer (optional)

Future Enhancements

Online multiplayer

Mobile application

Integration with advanced chess engines (Stockfish)

Training/hint mode
